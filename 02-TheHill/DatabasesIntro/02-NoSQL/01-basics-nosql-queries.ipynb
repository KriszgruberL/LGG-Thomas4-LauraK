    "# NoSQL: Basic queries on non-relational databases\n",

    "## NoSQL: Review\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database is designed to handle data that are not structured in tabular relations. The data can be stored in key-value pairs (like Python dictionaries), documents (JSON), or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../assets/nosql_vs_sql.jpeg\"  width = 500 px></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike relational databases (SQL), NoSQL does not (necessarily) employ tables and rows. Also they are much more flexible since the structure of the entries is not predefined. Therefore you can add data without defining anything (even not the table itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "[This article](https://www.integrate.io/blog/the-sql-vs-nosql-difference/) gives a recap of the biggest differences between SQL and NoSQL database systems:\n",
    "|SQL|NoSQL|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|SQL databases are relational| NoSQL databases are non-relational. In NoSQL you cannot make relationships between tables (`JOIN`)|\n",
    "|SQL databases are table-based |NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.|\n",
    "|SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema.| NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.|\n",
    "|SQL databases are vertically scalable (by adding processing power)|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable (by adding servers/machines).|\n",
    "|SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions|NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.|\n",
